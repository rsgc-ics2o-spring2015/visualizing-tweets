### B1: Programming concepts

#### Expectation B1.2

Early in this course, we were introduced to the concept of **variables**.

Variables allow a computer program to store data, or information, that must be kept track of.

In Processing (which is a language based on Java), a variable has both a *name* and a *type*.

In my independent study project, I made use of several different types of variables.

As [you can see here](https://github.com/rsgccs/visualizing-tweets/blob/master/trending_topics_visualizer/trending_topics_visualizer.pde#L10-17), I have declared variables of type:

* integer
* float
* float (as an array)
* boolean

Variables of type *integer* can store only integers, for example: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

Variables of type *float* can store both integers, and numbers with decimals, such as -2.342.

If you only need to store integer values, it is better to create a variable of type *integer*, as your program will both run faster and use less memory.

I have also made use of *boolean* variables.  Boolean variables use very little memory, as they can store only two values: *true* or *false*.

#### Expectation B1.5

In my ISP, I had to make use of looping structures in several places.

I [created several arrays](https://github.com/rsgccs/visualizing-tweets/blob/master/trending_topics_visualizer/trending_topics_visualizer.pde#L12-16) that track the position and speed at which the "[control](https://d2mjkw54krpgkk.cloudfront.net/userprofiles/40742/attachments/3cbddd4e0799211c468863c42c014322eaeda4ee-20150403112528811014-IMG_1450.JPG) [points](https://d2mjkw54krpgkk.cloudfront.net/userprofiles/40742/attachments/0d5ffdc39a0e5129ba448a4418b4de511f804902-20150403112529018463-IMG_1451.JPG)" in my sketch move.

In order to update these arrays, I had to [make](https://github.com/rsgccs/visualizing-tweets/blob/master/trending_topics_visualizer/trending_topics_visualizer.pde#L34-54) [use](https://github.com/rsgccs/visualizing-tweets/blob/master/trending_topics_visualizer/trending_topics_visualizer.pde#L75-87) of while loops.  The general idea is that since there are many elements in each array that need to be accesssed, or updated, I had to use a loop to move through each array and either access or update the value of each element.

### B2: Writing programs

#### Expectation B2.1

In planning my program, I made use of a visual-problem solving model â€“ specifically, a storyboard.

You can see the progression here:

1. The [initial appearance](https://d2mjkw54krpgkk.cloudfront.net/userprofiles/40742/attachments/0cf4b432f0dd406d084c1a12d6f5d41f642e7209-20150402130934624925-3.jpg) of my program.
2. The [appearance a little later](https://d2mjkw54krpgkk.cloudfront.net/userprofiles/40742/attachments/d858c6c259247c5d1ebce5edbc20a78195e98b5b-20150402130934724821-4.jpg_) (after some text has been read and counts of each letter of alphabet determined).
3. The [appearance after several "trending topics"](https://d2mjkw54krpgkk.cloudfront.net/userprofiles/40742/attachments/3dcc4e2fe3c009c7ab2fcca5c5894ab92df6b62d-20150402130935012985-5.jpg) have been visualized.

Planning out my program using storyboards, with point-form notes about what I intended my program to do, was helpful in organizing my thoughts about how to write the actual code.
