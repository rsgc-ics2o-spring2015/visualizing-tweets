### B1: Programming concepts

#### Expectation B1.2

Early in this course, we were introduced to the concept of **variables**.

Variables allow a computer program to store data, or information, that must be kept track of.

In Processing (which is a language based on Java), a variable has both a *name* and a *type*.

In my independent study project, I made use of several different types of data.

As [you can see here](https://github.com/rsgccs/visualizing-tweets/blob/master/trending_topics_visualizer/trending_topics_visualizer.pde#L10-17), I have declared variables of type:

* integer
* float
* float (as an array)
* boolean

Variables of type *integer* can store only integers, for example: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

Variables of type *float* can store both integers, and numbers with decimals, such as -2.342.

If you only need to store integer values, it is better to create a variable of type *integer*, as your program will both run faster and use less memory.

I have also made use of *boolean* variables.  Boolean variables use very little memory, as they can store only two values: *true* or *false*.
